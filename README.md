# 📝 To-Do List (C++ Project)

## 📄 Project Description

This is a simple **To-Do List application** developed using **C++**. It runs in the terminal and allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently. The program supports adding new tasks, viewing the current list of tasks, and deleting completed tasks by their number.  
This project was built to strengthen my understanding of **basic C++ concepts** like input/output, loops, conditionals, arrays, and functions.
